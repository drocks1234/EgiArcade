## 📖 How to Play

### Snake Game 🐍

Navigate your snake across the game board, eating food and growing in length while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. Earn points for each piece of food consumed, and see how high you can get your score!

### Simple Painting Game 🎨

Unleash your inner artist with the enhanced Painting Game! Import images, adjust their opacity, and move them around the canvas. Use the customizable brush to draw, choose different colors, and adjust the brush size. You can also clear your artwork, save your masterpiece as an image, or undo your last action.

### Number Guessing Game 🎲

Test your intuition with the Number Guessing Game! The game generates a secret number between 1 and 100, and your objective is to guess this number. You have 10 attempts per round, and your score decreases with each incorrect guess. A 'hot and cold' slider gives you a hint on how close your guess is to the secret number: red means you're hot (close), while blue means you're cold (far). The goal is to guess the secret number with as few attempts as possible to maximize your score!

### Blackjack ♠️♥️♦️♣️
