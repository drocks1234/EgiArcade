# Snake Game

This is a classic snake game where the player moves a snake around the game board and tries to eat food while avoiding collision with the walls or the snake's own body. The game is built with JavaScript and uses HTML canvas for rendering.

## Getting started

To play the game, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The game will start automatically and you can control the snake using the arrow keys on your keyboard. You can also adjust the game settings by clicking the "Settings" button.

## How to play

The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows in length and the player scores one point. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake:

- Left arrow key: Move the snake to the left
- Right arrow key: Move the snake to the right
- Up arrow key: Move the snake up
- Down arrow key: Move the snake down

## Game settings

The game settings can be accessed by clicking the "Settings" button. You can adjust the following settings:

- Game speed: Controls the speed at which the snake moves. The faster the speed, the more difficult the game becomes.
- Food spawn rate: Controls how often food appears on the game board. Increasing this setting will make the game easier by providing more opportunities to eat.
- Power-up spawn rate: Controls how often power-ups appear on the game board. Power-ups can provide various bonuses to the player, such as extra points or a longer snake.

## High scores

The game keeps track of your high score and displays it at the end of each game. Your high score is saved in your browser's local storage, so it will be remembered even if you close the browser. You can also view the local leaderboard by clicking the "Show Leaderboard" button on the main menu.
